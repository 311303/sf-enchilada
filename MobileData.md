# Mobile Data

> This page serves to document mobile data support on Enchilada.
> As of yet nobody has tested the second SIM slot, althought it should also be functional.

## Possible fix (confirmed working in the UK)

* Settings>WLAN>Disable WLAN (so the white dot turns grey)
* Pull down and tap "*Connect to Internet*", then tap on SIM 1
* Leave the phone on "*Connecting*" - it's safe the let the screen turn off.
* It should connect within a few minutes, if it does please [create an issue](https://github.com/sailfish-oneplus6/sf-enchilada/issues/new).
Please include "*[Data]*" in the title, and if possible include your region and data carrier.
